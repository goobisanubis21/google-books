# Description

The Google Books application I created allows a user to search for any book they want using the google books API. A user can search for a book, save a book theyre interested in, go to the saved page to see their list of saved books and view the book they saved by clicking the view button that redirects them to googles page where they can see more info about the book or buy it.
